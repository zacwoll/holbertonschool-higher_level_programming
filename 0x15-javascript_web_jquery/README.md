0x15-javascript-web_jquery

I used 
```python3 -m http.server 5000```
inside this directory, allowing me to select each html file from localhost:5000
5000 is both the port I open to my VM and the port on the VM, it's set up so that only I can access it, so no privacy issue there.
As you view each html file, the corresponding javascript script controls the logic of the page.
